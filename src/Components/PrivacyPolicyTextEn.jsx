          Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your
          device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much
          information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device
          you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other
          technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current
          location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
          collect this information either by refusing access to the information
          or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you
